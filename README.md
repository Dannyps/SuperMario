## Second Project

Our project goal is to create a Super Mario like game still side-scroller like the original, but with a couple twists. It will have a special boss with a different game mechanic with AI and it's also an Android game. We develop this game with the help of an DP API called Tiled https://www.mapeditor.org/ .
