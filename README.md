## Second Project
*Meraki* is a word that modern Greeks often use to describe doing something with soul, creativity, or love - when you put *"something of yourself"* into what you're doing, whatever it may be.
This word inspired us to develop an **Android app**, a to do list. From creating simple tasks to viewing them on the map, it has everything you might need. We used Java, SQLite and Google API's.
