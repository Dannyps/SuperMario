## Second Project

Our project goal is to create a Super Mario like game still side-scroller like the original, but with a couple twists. It will have a special boss with a different game mechanic with AI and it's also an Android game. We develop this game with the help of an DP API called Tiled https://www.mapeditor.org/ .

**How to play**
User has to click on play game button and game will begin.
To control Mario:
- Click on the rigth side screen and he move to the rigth;
- Click on the left side screen and he move to the left;
- Click on the button jump to jump.

**Conclusion**
We tried to develop tests, but JUnit did not recognize some libGDX specificationss.
We both work on the developed project and considered that we spent a lot of time working and resolve problems.
